Hello hello.

If you are reading this you might be a professor or someone interested in Deep Q-Learning. Hence, welcome !

This project has been done in the context of the course Mathematics of machine and deep learning algorithm at the Toulouse School of Economics for the second year of the master Data Science for Social Sciences.
This project aims to explore and implement Deep Q-learning algorithms in reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on MinAtar games. The project will encompass the development of a Deep Q-Learning agent from scratch, training and testing it in different environments (we will try it first in the environment of a CartPole game).

What are the purpose, structure and results ?
