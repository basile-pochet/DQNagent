# Deep Q-Learning and Munchausen Q-Learning Report

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the report, outlining the main topics to be covered. Mention the significance of Deep Q-Learning and the optional inclusion of Munchausen Q-Learning.

## Deep Q-Learning

### Background

Explain the background of Deep Q-Learning, including its motivation and the problem it aims to solve. Reference the seminal paper on Deep Q-Learning: [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).

### Key Concepts

Summarize the key concepts of Deep Q-Learning, including:

- Q-Learning
- Experience Replay
- Target Networks
- Exploration vs. Exploitation (Epsilon-Greedy)

### Architecture

Describe the architecture of a typical Deep Q-Learning network. Discuss the role of neural networks, input and output representations, and the learning process.

### Training Process

Detail the training process of a Deep Q-Learning model. Explain how the model learns from experiences, updates its parameters, and improves its performance over time.

### Challenges and Limitations

Discuss any challenges or limitations associated with Deep Q-Learning. Address issues such as stability, overestimation bias, and sample inefficiency.

## Munchausen Q-Learning (Optional)
