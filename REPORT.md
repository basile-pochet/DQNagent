# Deep Q-Learning

## Introduction

If we want to talk about Deep Q-Learning we need to introduce Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Learning being a type of RL.
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that trains algorithms to learn from their environments through trial and error. To do that, an agent is given information about its environment and do an action accordingly. It receives then a reward or a punishment so it can optimize its behaviors over time. The data is ccumulated through the agent's interactions with the environment. 
Reinforcement learning is being used in various domains such as game playing, autonomous systems, robotics etc and is a powerful approach for training intelligent agents.

## Deep Q-Learning

### Background

Explain the background of Deep Q-Learning, including its motivation and the problem it aims to solve. Reference the seminal paper on Deep Q-Learning: [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).

### Key Concepts

Summarize the key concepts of Deep Q-Learning, including:

- Q-Learning
- Experience Replay
- Target Networks
- Exploration vs. Exploitation (Epsilon-Greedy)

### Architecture

Describe the architecture of a typical Deep Q-Learning network. Discuss the role of neural networks, input and output representations, and the learning process.

### Training Process

Detail the training process of a Deep Q-Learning model. Explain how the model learns from experiences, updates its parameters, and improves its performance over time.

### Challenges and Limitations

Discuss any challenges or limitations associated with Deep Q-Learning. Address issues such as stability, overestimation bias, and sample inefficiency.
